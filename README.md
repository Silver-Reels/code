Silver Reels

This is the repository for my portfolio website, silverreels.netlify.app

Netlify is connected to this repository. It hosts the site & mostly handles the back-end, though I've also made use of their serverless functions to API call some GraphQL data.

This also contains my proprietary tool INKR, an implementation that uses custom SVG's, custom SVG CSS clip-paths and JS to generate real-time animated cursive text right inside HTML pages from simple text input from a user.
